# mess_menu

A Trial Flutter project.
It Shows the menu present in the Hostel mess and changes each day
Supposed to send a notification at fixed times in the day 



BUGS
 - currently the notifications appear at random times. might try a different method to call notifications as thats the only reason that I can think of
 - The code needs to be heavily cleaned as it was mainly for experimentation and was made without any proper tutorail to learn from




> missing the build folder currently as it has too many files to upload at once, not sure if thats important. im not sure how to really upload flutter files
